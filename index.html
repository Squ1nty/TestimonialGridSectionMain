            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
            more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny' worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've bee looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it icnredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
            startup."

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance 
              from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

              present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is aboce the rest. You

            Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure 
            from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to 
            enrollm by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
            had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It 
            took my learning to the enxt level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've 
            often referred to it during the interviews as an example of my development experience. It 
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
            100% recommend! "
